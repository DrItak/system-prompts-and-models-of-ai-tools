# Feature Ideas

Here are three feature ideas for this repository:

1.  **Prompt Analyzer and Scorer:** A tool that automatically analyzes and scores each prompt based on criteria like clarity, completeness, and adherence to best practices. The scores would be presented in a summary table, helping users quickly compare the quality of different prompts.

2.  **Prompt Comparison Tool:** A side-by-side comparison tool that would allow users to select multiple prompts and view their differences in areas like persona, available tools, and communication guidelines. This would be valuable for users deciding which AI assistant to use or for those creating custom prompts.

3.  **Prompt Template Generator:** A feature that would provide users with a template and pre-defined components to create their own custom prompts. By selecting a persona, tools, and other parameters, users could easily generate well-structured and comprehensive prompts.
